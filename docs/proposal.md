### Architecture and Technologies

This project will be implemented with the following technologies:

- Vanilla JavaScript and `jquery` for overall structure and logic,
- `HTML5` and `CSS3` for all for DOM manipulation and rendering,
- Webpack to bundle and serve up the various scripts.

### Implementation Timeline

**Day 1**: Setup all necessary Node modules, including getting webpack up and running and `Easel.js` installed.  Create `webpack.config.js` as well as `package.json`.  Write a basic entry file and the bare bones of all 3 scripts outlined above.

**Day 2**: Collect all the CSS code for the CSS features. Build the user interface out with the CSS functions and the forms that user will type their CSS into.

**Day 3**: Build out the backside of the program. Create the tutorials so that when a user types the backend checks to see if their code is correct.

**Day 4**: Style the frontend, making it polished and professional. Make sure everything works.


### Bonus feature

Add a more detailed step by step tutorial so the user can add their own code and it renders on the page
