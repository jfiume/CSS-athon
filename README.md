## Project Design

CSS-athon was built in 4 days.

A proposal was drafted to help provide an implementation timeline for the development process.

## Technology

- Vanilla JavaScript and `jquery` for overall structure and logic,
- `HTML5` and `CSS3` for all for DOM manipulation and rendering,
- Webpack to bundle and serve up the various scripts.

## Future Implementations

CSS-athon could be improved with the addition of a few future implementations:

- Add a more detailed step by step tutorial building on the current functionality.
- Add tests with automation.
- Make each tutorial a CSS slide show.
