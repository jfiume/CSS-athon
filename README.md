# CSS-athon!

CSS-athon is a fun front end web application that teaches users to learn advanced CSS animations through short tutorials.

CSS-athon is a personal project by Joseph Fiume

## Features

-  Users see the CSS feature in action when hovering over the item
-  Users input their own CSS code and see if it matches the correct CSS code for the function
-  Hint button shows/hides hints for the code
-  Several CSS effects are highlighted such as pseudo-classes, transforms, transitions, and animations

## Project Design

CSS-athon was built in 4 days.

A proposal was drafted to help provide an implementation timeline for the development process.

## Technology

- Vanilla JavaScript and `jquery` for overall structure and logic,
- `HTML5` and `CSS3` for all for DOM manipulation and rendering,
- Webpack to bundle and serve up the various scripts.

## Future Implementations

CSS-athon could be improved with the addition of a few future implementations:

- Add a more detailed step by step tutorial building on the current functionality.
- Add tests with automation.
